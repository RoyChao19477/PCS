# Post-processing PCS

The proposed PCS can also be used as a post-processing (PP) method.  
Here, we offer you an easy way to use it.  

## Requirements
- torch
- torchaudio
- librosa
- numpy
- scipy
- argparse

## How to use ?
The audio to be processed should be placed in a folder. (denote as **input_folder**)  
- You should modify the `--input_folder` (folder path), and `--output_folder` (folder path) in `runPCS.sh` first.
- Then execute `sh runPCS.sh`. The audio processed by PP-PCS will be saved to the `--output_folder`.
