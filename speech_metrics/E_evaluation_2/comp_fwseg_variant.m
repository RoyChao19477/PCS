%      Frequency-variant fwSNRseg Objective Speech Quality Measure
%
%   This function implements the frequency-variant fwSNRseg measure [1]
%   (see also Chap. 10, Eq. 10.24)
%
%
%   Usage:  [sig,bak,ovl]=comp_fwseg_variant(cleanFile.wav, enhancedFile.wav)
%           
%         cleanFile.wav - clean input file in .wav format
%         enhancedFile  - enhanced output file in .wav format
%         sig           - predicted rating [1-5] of speech distortion
%         bak           - predicted rating [1-5] of noise distortion
%         ovl           - predicted rating [1-5] of overall quality
%
%
%  Example call:  [s,b,o] =comp_fwseg_variant('sp04.wav','enhanced.wav')
