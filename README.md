# Perceptual Contrast Stretching on Target Feature for Speech Enhancement
**This is the post-processing PCS part.**  
  
Enhanced audios are generated by different baseline models to which post-processing PCS is then applied.  
The experimental results are as follows:

## Introduction
"PCS is derived based on the critical band importance function and applied to modify the targets of the SE model."  
"It can also be used as a post-processing (PP) method to further sharpen the structure of enhanced speech and suppress residual noise."  
More details can be found in here: Link-Here  
**This repo is only dedicated to the post processing PCS.**

## PCS-tools
Post-processing PCS tools can be found at `/PCS`. So you can simply post-process the audio with PCS.  

## Scoring-tools
Speech metric scores were computed with `/speech_metrics`.
