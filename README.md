## **Update (May 11, 2024)**: 
For Speech Enhancement Systems utilizing a 400-sample window frame in the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we recommend using **PCS400** instead of PCS. This adjustment helps prevent distortion due to mismatching.

## Introduction
"PCS is derived based on the critical band importance function and applied to modify the targets of the SE model."  
"It can also be used as a post-processing (PP) method to further sharpen the structure of enhanced speech and suppress residual noise."  
  
More details can be found in here: [**http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17152**](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17152) (Preprint arXiv; Accepted by **INTERSPEECH 2022**)  
  
> **This repo is only dedicated to the post-processing PCS.**  
  
Enhanced audios are generated by different baseline models to which post-processing PCS is then applied.  
The experimental results are as follows:

## PCS-tools
Post-processing PCS tools can be found at `/PCS` folder.  
So you can simply post-process the audio with PCS.  

## Scoring-tools
Speech metric scores were computed with `/speech_metrics`.
